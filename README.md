# AI Traffic Surveillance: Monitoring the City of Calgary's Traffic Counts using the YOLOv5 AI model
Monitoring traffic flow and congestion in real time poses a significant challenge due to
the expense and logistical hurdles associated with deploying physical sensors on roads.
Traditional monitoring solutions are costly to install and maintain, limiting their scalability and
accessibility. The absence of real-time data inhibits effective traffic management strategies for
urban planners, traffic authorities, and the public. Addressing this issue requires a cost-effective,
scalable, and versatile solution that leverages existing infrastructure.

To tackle the challenge of real-time traffic monitoring, we developed a web application
that utilizes City of Calgary traffic camera infrastructure and the YOLOv5 deep learning object recognition AI model.
Our application provides an automated system for monitoring traffic flow and congestion, offering valuable insights
through a user-friendly interface. The application accurately counts vehicles and generates insights into traffic
patterns by analyzing real-time images from existing traffic cameras.

Our Traffic Dashboard offers users and planners almost real-time information on traffic
conditions, aiding in decision-making processes for optimizing traffic flows, enhancing road
safety, and improving road management for city planning purposes. By utilizing existing traffic
camera infrastructure, our solution significantly reduces deployment and maintenance costs
compared to traditional sensor-based systems. Additionally, the accessibility and scalability of
our application make it a valuable tool for a wide range of stakeholders involved in traffic
management and urban planning.
